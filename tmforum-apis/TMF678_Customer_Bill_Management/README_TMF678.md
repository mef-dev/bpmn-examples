## Customer Bill Management TMF678
In the realm of billing and invoicing, the "Customer Bill Management TMF678" API emerges as a game-changer. MEF.DEV's implementation facilitates the identification and retrieval of customer bills, providing a comprehensive view of applied customer billing rates. This standardized approach streamlines the billing process, demonstrating how open APIs can revolutionize rating and billing processes in telecom.

The Customer Bill Management API encompasses business entities integral to Rating and Billing processes, providing operations for the identification and retrieval of details regarding applied customer billing rates for products subscribed by a customer. Typically, these products are rated at varying prices determined by product offering prices, pricing rules, and additional terms and conditions specified by the customer.

The Customer Bill Management REST API facilitates the retrieval of information from one or multiple customer bills (also referred to as invoices) generated for a customer. A customer bill serves as an electronic or paper document produced after the billing process, consolidating and displaying various items (applied customer billing rates generated during the rating and billing processes) to be charged to a customer. It represents the total amount due for all products during the billing period, encompassing critical information such as dates and bill references.

This API model accommodates the requirements for three fundamental billing types: postpaid and prepaid periodical bills, as well as bill operation by request, and bills with scheduled installment payment guidelines. Furthermore, this API allows for the identification and retrieval of details related to bill cycles. By offering standardized operations for the identification and retrieval of customer billing rates, the API ensures that communication service providers can deliver accurate and timely bills to their customers. The flexibility to accommodate different billing types further enhances the adaptability of the solution to diverse business models within the telecom industry.
