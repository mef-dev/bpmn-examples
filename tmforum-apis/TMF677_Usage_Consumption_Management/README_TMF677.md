## Usage Consumption Management TMF677
The "Usage Consumption Management TMF677" API encompasses the assessment of consumption levels associated with products, services, or resources pertaining to one or more parties. This method facilitates the retrieval of information concerning remaining, global, or utilized bucket values, including instances of exceptional consumption commonly referred to as out-of-bucket consumption. The Usage Consumption API provides the following operations: a listing of existing usage consumption queries based on filter criteria, retrieval of an existing usage consumption query by its identifier, and creation of a new query for usage consumption.

Despite the existence of diverse Usage Consumption API resources within the TM Forum design, the minimal implementation doesnâ€™t require certain activities due to the Online mode of operations execution. These optional activities encompass the deletion of an existing query for usage consumption and notification of events, specifically QueryUsageConsumption creation or removal events.

This strategic approach ensures that the Usage Consumption Management API within WideCoup BSS aligns with the online execution model, focusing on efficient retrieval and creation functionalities while maintaining flexibility for future utilization. As the telecom industry continues to evolve, the ability to assess and manage consumption levels with precision becomes a critical factor in delivering exceptional services to end-users.
