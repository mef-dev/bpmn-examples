## Service Usage Management TMF727
Precision in managing service usage is paramount, and the "Service Usage Management TMF727" API encapsulates this need. It incorporates the ServiceUsage method, offering a standardized mechanism for the management of service usage. This includes the retrieval and export of a collection of service usages. The creation option for service usage is successfully complemented by ETL features, given the diverse Extract, Transform, and Load scenarios.

In this context, a service usage denotes an instance of usage on a Service derived from various Resource usages. These usages can be further employed by Omni-channels or other systems to disseminate Product usage values. Each service usage is characterized by attributes, representing its inherent properties. The ServiceUsage API facilitates the retrieval of a ServiceUsage or a collection of ServiceUsage, contingent on filter criteria.

Furthermore, the ServiceUsageSpecification entity within the BSS Template establishes a standardized mechanism for the management of service usage specifications. This encompasses the handling of custom sets of service usage characteristics. The ServiceUsageSpecification offers a detailed description of a service usage event, capturing attributes of interest to the business.

Similar to ServiceUsage, it is comprised of characteristics that define all attributes known for a specific type of usage. Specifically, the optional for implementation activities are the creation of a ServiceUsage, partial update of a ServiceUsage or a collection of ServiceUsage, creation of a ServiceUsageSpecification, and partial update of a ServiceUsageSpecification or a collection of ServiceUsageSpecification.

This optionality aligns with the online execution model, focusing on the retrieval and export functionalities while reserving specific activities for future scenarios. By navigating this delicate balance, MEF.DEV ensures that the Service Usage Management API remains a robust and efficient tool for managing service usage within the ever-evolving telecom landscape.
