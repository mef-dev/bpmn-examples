## Account Management TMF666
The "Account Management TMF666" API establishes a standardized mechanism for billing and settlement accounts administration. This ensures a seamless process within both B2C and B2B contexts. The API facilitates the creation, modification, and retrieval of account information, operating within the scope of diverse account entities such as FinancialAccount, PartyAccount, BillingAccount, and SettlementAccount.

The minimal implementation exclusively encompasses the BillingAccount entity. This strategic focus streamlines access to all accounts using either the Account internal identifier or the Customer ID. Notably, in creating a BillingAccount from inception, the utilization of Customer entity creation is anticipated, accompanied by external identifiers for future synchronization purposes.
