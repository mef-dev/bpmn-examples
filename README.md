From creating new services to modifying inflight service creation and overall lifecycle management, the API ensures a holistic approach to service activation and configuration.

Activities such as monitoring long-running service creation processes, creating inactive services, modifying inflight service creation, and canceling inflight service creation are not required for minimal implementation This strategic decision aligns with the need for a seamless and rapid execution model, contributing to the efficiency of the service activation and configuration processes.

## Service Usage Management TMF727
Precision in managing service usage is paramount, and the "Service Usage Management TMF727" API encapsulates this need. It incorporates the ServiceUsage method, offering a standardized mechanism for the management of service usage. This includes the retrieval and export of a collection of service usages. The creation option for service usage is successfully complemented by ETL features, given the diverse Extract, Transform, and Load scenarios.

In this context, a service usage denotes an instance of usage on a Service derived from various Resource usages. These usages can be further employed by Omni-channels or other systems to disseminate Product usage values. Each service usage is characterized by attributes, representing its inherent properties. The ServiceUsage API facilitates the retrieval of a ServiceUsage or a collection of ServiceUsage, contingent on filter criteria.

Furthermore, the ServiceUsageSpecification entity within the BSS Template establishes a standardized mechanism for the management of service usage specifications. This encompasses the handling of custom sets of service usage characteristics. The ServiceUsageSpecification offers a detailed description of a service usage event, capturing attributes of interest to the business.

Similar to ServiceUsage, it is comprised of characteristics that define all attributes known for a specific type of usage. Specifically, the optional for implementation activities are the creation of a ServiceUsage, partial update of a ServiceUsage or a collection of ServiceUsage, creation of a ServiceUsageSpecification, and partial update of a ServiceUsageSpecification or a collection of ServiceUsageSpecification.

This optionality aligns with the online execution model, focusing on the retrieval and export functionalities while reserving specific activities for future scenarios. By navigating this delicate balance, MEF.DEV ensures that the Service Usage Management API remains a robust and efficient tool for managing service usage within the ever-evolving telecom landscape.

MEF.DEV's implementation facilitates the identification and retrieval of customer bills, providing a comprehensive view of applied customer billing rates. This standardized approach streamlines the billing process, demonstrating how open APIs can revolutionize rating and billing processes in telecom.

The Customer Bill Management API encompasses business entities integral to Rating and Billing processes, providing operations for the identification and retrieval of details regarding applied customer billing rates for products subscribed by a customer. Typically, these products are rated at varying prices determined by product offering prices, pricing rules, and additional terms and conditions specified by the customer.

The Customer Bill Management REST API facilitates the retrieval of information from one or multiple customer bills (also referred to as invoices) generated for a customer. A customer bill serves as an electronic or paper document produced after the billing process, consolidating and displaying various items (applied customer billing rates generated during the rating and billing processes) to be charged to a customer. It represents the total amount due for all products during the billing period, encompassing critical information such as dates and bill references.

This API model accommodates the requirements for three fundamental billing types: postpaid and prepaid periodical bills, as well as bill operation by request, and bills with scheduled installment payment guidelines. Furthermore, this API allows for the identification and retrieval of details related to bill cycles. By offering standardized operations for the identification and retrieval of customer billing rates, the API ensures that communication service providers can deliver accurate and timely bills to their customers. The flexibility to accommodate different billing types further enhances the adaptability of the solution to diverse business models within the telecom industry.
